The anchors are possibly the most imporant part of these figures since they allow you to connect these figures to the rest of your drawing. Therefore, we have tried to make the anchors as consistent as possible in terms of naming. The most common abbreviations for anchors that you will find in Section \ref{sec: Assets} are the following:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|lcc|l}
        Abbreviation & Anchor name & & Abbreviation & Anchor name \\
        \hline & & & & \\
        N & north & & S & south\\
        nN & near north & & nS & near south \\
        fN & far north & & fS & far south \\
        & & & & \\
        E & east & & W & west \\
        nE & near east & & nW & near west \\
        fE & far east  & & fW & far west \\
        & & & & \\
        NE & northeast & &  SE & southeast \\
        nNE & near northeast & &  nSE & near southeast \\
        fNE & far northeast & &  fSE & far southeast \\
        & & & & \\
        NW & northwest & & SW & southwest \\
        nNW & near northwest & &  nSW & near southwest \\
        fNW & far northwest & &  fSW & far southwest \\
        & & & & \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Most assets will only use (a selection of) these anchors. \textbf{Not every anchor is defined for every asset. Please check the section of the asset to see which are defined for that asset.}  If it uses more than these, they are specified in the section of that asset, e.g. Tanks.
